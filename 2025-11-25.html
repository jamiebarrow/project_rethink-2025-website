There are people, who, having began life, by setting their boat against wind and tide, are always complaining of their bad luck, and always just ready to give up and for that very reason are always helpless and good for nothing, and yet, if they would persevere, hard as it may be, to work up steam all your life long, they would have their reward at last.
Good voyages are made both ways!
A certain amount of opposition is a great help to a man.
Kites rise against not with the wind.
Even a head wind is better than nothing.
No man ever worked his voyage anywhere in a dead calm.
-- John Neal
